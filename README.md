Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game
===============================

HOW TO USE
----------

Open the game by visiting my gh-page - http://heckelsa.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/ or click on index.html.

The game starts immediately after opening.

Use the four arrows - up, down, right, left - to move the player on the field. Try to navigate around the bugs. If you collide with a bug, your Player dies and is set back to the start position.
